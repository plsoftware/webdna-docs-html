To complete your Netscape installation, open "Administer Netscape Servers" from the
Netscape program group, or go directly to the URL for Netscape
administration.
<ol>
<li>Select the server to administer and click the "Programs"
button in the top frame.
<li>Click the "ShellCGI Directory" link in the left
frame in order to create a new directory for shell CGI's.
<li>Enter "cgi-bin" as the URL prefix and "C:\Netscape\Server\cgi-shl" as the path to your
shell CGI directory (unless you chose to place your CGI files elsewhere
during the WebDNA installation - enter the path you selected during
installation).
<li>Be sure NOT TO type a slash character at the end of the
directory path. Click "OK" and then "Apply" in the top frame.
</ol>

Next, you must add a file extension mapping to the "mime.types" file found in
your server's "config" directory. By default, the path to this file is
similar to the following: "C:\Netscape\Server\httpd-XXX\config\mime.types"
(replace XXX with your server name). Open the file with a text editor (like Notepad) and add the following line
to the end of the file: "type=magnus-internal/shellcgi exts=tpl". Consult the Netscape
instructions (by clicking "Help" from the Administration page) for updated
or different instructions on creating extension mapping in the documents
directory. After saving the file, restart your server. If the mapping
doesn't seem to work correctly, you may have to restart your machine as
well.
