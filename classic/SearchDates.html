<DL>
  <DD>Uses dates or times as part of a search.
</DL>

<P>WebDNA normally compares all fields in a database as though
they were text, even if they look like dates to you. Unless you
tell it to compare a field as a date (or as a time or a <A HREF="SearchNumbers.html">number</A>),
all comparisons are alphabetical.</P>

<P>If your database has a date field (SoldDate, for instance)
that you wish to sort in date-order, you would put something like
the following in the search criteria:</P>

<P>http://Results.tpl?command=search&amp;<B>ge</B>SoldDate<B>data</B>=2/17/96&amp;SoldDate<B>type=date</B></P>

<P>Alternately, if your database has a time field (SoldTime, for
instance) that you wish to sort in time-order, you would put something
like the following in the search criteria:</P>

<P>http://Results.tpl?command=search&amp;<B>ge</B>SoldTime<B>data</B>=10:15:00&amp;SoldTime<B>type=time</B></P>

<P>Why is this important? Imagine that WebDNA is comparing
two fields that happen to contain dates in them:</P>

<P>Compare &quot;2/12/1997&quot; to &quot;12/9/1997&quot; -- when
compared alphabetically, WebDNA looks at the first letter
in both fields and sees &quot;2&quot; and &quot;1&quot;, respectively.
In this case, it would (wrongly) assume that &quot;2&quot; is
greater than &quot;1&quot; (which in an alphabetical sense is
true), and would sort &quot;12/9/1997&quot; <B>after</B> &quot;2/12/1997&quot;.
This is probably not what you meant.</P>

<P>When compared as dates, the two numbers would sort correctly.</P>

<P>WebDNA accepts dates that look like &quot;month/day/year&quot;,
as in &quot;4/19/97&quot; and &quot;4/19/1997&quot;. It uses the
global date format preference to decide what order the month/day/year
fields are stored (so you can use 1997/05/27 as long as you set
the date preference to display dates in that format). All <A 
HREF="SearchSorting.html">sorting</A>, <A HREF="SearchSummaries.html">summaries</A>,
and <A HREF="SearchComparisons.html">comparisons</A> work correctly
when you tell WebDNA which fields are to be treated as dates.</P>
