<dl>
			<dd>Creates summaries from a search.
		</dl>
		<p>Sometimes you want WebDNA to summarize information in a database by only showing records that are unique in a particular field. For instance, if your database contains a list of names and addresses, you may want to see how many unique zip codes are in the database. To summarize records, add &quot;<i>FieldName</i><b>summ=T</b>&quot; to a search command.</p>
		<p>If your database has a field called &quot;ZipCode,&quot; and you want to look for records with unique values and greater than 90000 in the ZipCode field, then enter a URL something like this:</p>
		<p>http://Results.tpl?command=search&amp;<b>ge</b>ZipCode<b>data</b>=90000&amp;ZipCode<b>summ=T</b>&amp;ZipCode<b>sort=1</b>&amp;db=SomeDatabase.db</p>
		<p>The template &quot;Results.tpl&quot; display after the search, and any <a href="FoundItemsContext.html">[FoundItems] </a>contexts in it fill with found records. &quot;ge&quot; stands for &quot;greater than or equal,&quot; meaning the ZipCode field must be greater than or equal to 90000, otherwise it will not be considered a match. ZipCode<b>sort=1</b> causes the results to be sorted in ascending order by ZipCode. ZipCode<b>summ=T</b> tells WebDNA that if one or more zip code are identical, they are removed from the list of found items. Only the first matching ZipCode record is displayed.</p>
		<dl>
			<dd><b>Note:</b> it is important to sort by the same field you wish to summarize -- this sorting enables WebDNA to easily see when a field changes from one value to another in the sequence of found items.
