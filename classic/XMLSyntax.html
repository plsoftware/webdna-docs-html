<h2>XML Syntax Explanation</h2>
<p>To give everyone a head start on playing with the new-style syntax, here's 
  a primer. We are calling it XML syntax only because it is not HTML and it tends 
  to follow the guidelines of XML and it looks a lot like XML. It is basically 
  just the type of syntax that most graphical editors like Dreamweaver tend to 
  expect, and *not* chew up like the original [classic] syntax. </p>
<p>The general rules is to substitute &quot;[&quot; with &quot;&lt;DNA_&quot;, 
  &quot;]&quot; with &quot;&gt;&quot;, and named quoted-value pairs instead of 
  ampersand-delimited pairs. You can see a the new syntax in the included TeaRoomXML 
  example, which has been ported to XML syntax. So the following classic syntax:</p>
<pre align="left">&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS-->
[loop start=1&end=10] 
[index]
[/loop] </pre>
<p>becomes </p>
<pre>&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS_XML-->
&lt;DNA_loop start=&quot;1&quot; end=&quot;10&quot;&gt; 
&lt;DNA_index&gt;
&lt;/DNA_loop&gt; </pre>
<dna_index> 
<p>All parameters *must* be named, and *must* be quoted, even if they are numeric 
  or have no spaces in them (also a rule of XML). At some point we may even go 
  so far as to require lowercase tag and parameter names, as XML does, in order 
  to help out with future XML editors.</p>
<p> Certain contexts such as [ShowIf] are required to have a named parameter, 
  so they become: </p>
<pre>&lt;DNA_ShowIf expr=&quot;12&lt;13&quot;&gt;...&lt;/DNA_ShowIf&gt;</pre>
<p>You can't get away with unnamed parameters for [Include] either:</p>
<pre>&lt;DNA_Include file=&quot;fred&quot;&gt;</pre>
<p> Again, all of these named things may look funny when you type them out, but 
  they help products like Dreamweaver immensely.</p>
<p> In order to make it easier for you to port sites one-page-at-a-time, we have 
  gone to great lengths to let you intermix the syntax. [include], for instance, 
  automatically assumes the file you're including will be the same syntax as the 
  template you're including *from*. </p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS--&gt;</font> 
  means classic syntax for this whole page<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS_XML--&gt;</font> 
  means XML syntax for this whole page</p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[include file=fred.inc]</font> will 
  parse fred.inc using classic syntax<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[include file=fred.inc&xmlSyntax=T]</font> 
  will parse fred.inc using XML syntax </p>
<p> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;DNA_Include file=&quot;fred.inc&quot;&gt;</font> 
  will parse fred.inc using XML syntax<br>
  <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">&lt;DNA_Include file=&quot;fred.inc&quot; 
  xmlSyntax=&quot;F&quot;&gt;</font>will parse fred.inc using classic syntax </p>
<p> Be careful with quotes! It is easy to forget and write something like <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[include 
  file="fred.inc"]</font> <-- those quotes are literal in classic syntax, and 
  will create wrong results, where it will look for the literal quote in the filename. 
</p>
<p>Embedded quotes need to be escaped, also to help with Dreamweaver parsers:<br>
</p>
<pre>&lt;DNA_ShowIf expr=&quot;the letter \&quot;a\" ! \&quot;b\&quot;&gt;&quot;&gt;&quot;</pre>
<p> The idea here is that expr="...a bunch of stuff..." must know when it's hit 
  the ending quote. So any embedded quotes you put inside have to be preceded 
  by \, just like you do in JavaScript. </p>
<p>Arrays: the old trick of using [interpret][array[index]][/interpret] still 
  works in XML syntax, but we had to do some fancy footwork to recognize it. <br>
  The syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre>&lt;DNA_Interpret&gt;&lt;DNA_array&lt;DNA_Index&gt;&gt;&lt;/DNA_Interpret&gt;</pre>
<dna_array><dna_index>Undefined variables: classic syntax still treats undefined 
[x] as literally "[x]", in order to handle the case where you're just typing some 
plain text on a page that happens to have brackets around it. We did this because 
we have no way of knowing when you mean literal text and when you mean WebDNA 
variables. But under XML syntax, we know for certain that you are trying to get 
at a variable, because there is no ambiguity about <dna_x> being a WebDNA construct. 
So in that case we output "undefined" in its place.
