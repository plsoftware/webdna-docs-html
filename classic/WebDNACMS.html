        WHAT IS WEBDNA CMS?</h2>
      <p> WebDNA Enterprise CMS is a client-server solution that will aggregate 
        three well-known patterns: CMS (Content Management System), RCS (Revision 
        Control System), and CVS (Concurrent Versions System). For the WebDNA 
        Enterprise CMS system, the functionality involved with these three different 
        aspects will be inseparable. <br>
        <br>
        Development teams (&#8220;workgroups&#8221;) are created and individual 
        users gain membership to one or more of these teams. The concept of privilege-based 
        roles applies to team membership, meaning that given a context workgroup, 
        an individual user is assigned one or more roles. Privileges are assigned 
        statically to an individual role.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="imageCMS.jpg" width="396" height="287"> </p>
      <p> <br>
        First, the authentication/privileges mechanism is the functions as the 
        entry point to consuming system functionality. A given user must first 
        authenticate prior to using the system. All content-manipulation/functionality 
        will be initiated and invoked via an intuitive GUI-based client, based 
        on the familiar file-browser &#8220;explorer&#8221; pattern. </p>
      <p><strong>Content Management System Component</strong><br>
        The CMS aspect will allow users within a given development workgroup to 
        manage and organize their individual document/project development efforts 
        based on the familiar file/directory-structure paradigm. Depending on 
        the privileges assigned to the user, the user may, for example, create 
        new, move, and delete files and directories (content).</p>
      <p><strong>Revision Control System Component</strong><br>
        The RCS aspect will track modifications made to content based on the familiar 
        check-out/modify/check-in paradigm. Given that modification history will 
        be persisted, the system will also allow rolling back to previous versions 
        should the need arise.</p>
      <p><strong>Concurrent Versions System Component</strong><br>
        The CVS aspect is based on exclusive-locks. As such, it will track file-locks 
        and modifications in other workgroup&#8217;s work areas so that two users 
        will not be allowed to have the same content (but in a different work 
        area) locked concurrently. All modifications are submitted from a given 
        workgroup&#8217;s work area to a staging area, simply referred to as &#8220;Staging&#8221;. 
        The revision/version in Staging then becomes the master against which 
        potentially disparate versions in other workgroup&#8217;s work areas are 
        compared. </p>
      <p>Optionally, an admin (workgroup or sysadmin) can specify a structured 
        approval workflow/chain, indicating that various users must flag the request 
        as either approved or denied. In general, a workflow is a map of a set 
        of approval checkpoints. An approval &#8220;checkpoint&#8221; is simply 
        a combination of a workgroup user and his approval/denial. The actual 
        approval checkpoint map can vary but overall it is a collective indication 
        of whether or not a given submission request gets processed. </p>
      <h2>USING WEBDNA CMS</h2>
      <p> <em>Note: There is a right-button context menu that works in both the 
        tree view and list view. For MAC users with only one button, there is 
        a 'menu' icon in the list view that pops up the same thing.</em></p>
      <p><strong>User Types</strong><br>
        There are five 'roles' users can assume:</p>
      <p><strong>&middot; WGadmin</strong> &#8211; This privilege provides administrative 
        privileges for a given workgroup.</p>
      <p><strong>&middot; Editor</strong> &#8211; This privilege can edit content 
        of a given workgroup, but you cannot create new content or delete content.</p>
      <p><strong>&middot; Author</strong> &#8211; This privilege can edit, create, 
        or delete content in a given workgroup.</p>
      <p><strong>&middot; Viewer </strong>&#8211; This privilege has read only 
        access.</p>
      <p><strong>&middot; Unauthorized</strong> &#8211; This privilege provides 
        no access. It is useful for disabling access for a user who should not 
        be fully deleted from the system. </p>
      <p>Every user can see the WorkGroup Admin tab. This is done to allow users 
        to see who belongs to a given workgroup. However, only a WGAdmin for that 
        particular workgroup can change the settings for users.</p>
      <p><strong>Approval Groups</strong><br>
        The WGAdmin for a particular workgroup can establish the approval groups. 
        Once a approval group is created, the staging admin can then 'attach' 
        an approval group to any particular asset within staging&#8217;s files 
        or folders. Any time an asset is checked in, the check in process searches 
        recursively from that 'leaf' asset up the hierarchy until it finds an 
        approval group. </p>
      <p>For example: If you want one approval group for all of staging, you attach 
        it to the root staging folder. If you want a particular subfolder to have 
        a different approval group, you attach it to that subfolder. Setting a 
        different approval group for a subfolder will allow the recursive search 
        to be encountered first before any approval group 'above' it. </p>
      <p>If you have an approval group assigned to a folder, and you have one 
        file that you DO NOT want any approval required ... create an 'empty' 
        approval group and attach it to that one file. It will be encountered 
        first before the approval group attached to the folder containing the 
        file. </p>
      <p><strong>Staging Content</strong><br>
        The 'staging' workgroup is the repository for all file change history. 
        If you add new files or folders in your respective workgroups, they have 
        to be 'checked-in' to become part of the staging repository. Likewise, 
        if you delete a file or folder, it needs to be checked-in for that change 
        to affect staging. If there is an approval workflow defined, the deletion 
        has to be approved before it is applied.</p>
      <p><strong>Deploying Content</strong><br>
        There is a 'deploy' action under the Workgroup Admin tab, which launches 
        a separate (empty) template in its own window. This template does not 
        perform any operations. </p>
      <p>Since deploying folder and files to production could be local or remote 
        operations, or involve any number of 'custom' issues for a given customer, 
        this one template will be unencrypted so you can create your own custom 
        WebDNA to automate the deployment from the staging area into production.</p>
      <p><strong>Uploading Multiple Files</strong><br>
        There is a mechanism to &quot;add a file&quot; and to &quot;upload&quot; 
        a file over an existing file (if it is already checked out). For 'bulk' 
        uploads of numerous files, there is an 'upload' folder under the CMS instance 
        directory where a user can perform bulk FTPs of files. After the bulk 
        upload, the user can use the &quot;upload files&quot; action, which will 
        then import all of the files from that folder into the CMS system.<br>
