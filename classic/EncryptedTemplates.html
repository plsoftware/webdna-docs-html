<p><font size="5"><b>Appendix D: How to create encrypted templates</b></font></p>
<p>In addition to encrypting text using WebDNA’s [encrypt] context, you can 
  encrypt entire WebDNA templates so they can be distributed and used without 
  having the raw WebDNA in the templates visible. This is very useful for developers 
  wishing to sell WebDNA-based solutions.</p>
<p>Sometimes you will want to give someone else a WebDNA template without letting 
  them see your "source code" in the file. For example, if you create a WebDNA 
  solution that is for sale, you may not want others to be able to read the templates 
  and make modifications or see your proprietary algorithms.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Encrypting Templates</h2>
<p> To create an encrypted template, you must first design and debug the template 
  as you normally would. Then use the [Encrypt] context with a seed of your choosing 
  to create the encrypted version of the original template. Note that you shouldn’t 
  make your seed value public in any way. After the templates have been encrypted, 
  a special tag must be added to the top of the file so it can be recognized as 
  an encrypted file and then your seed value must be encrypted using WebDNA’s 
  default encryption.</p>
<p>Use the following WebDNA to encrypt your file and add the special tag to the 
  beginning of the file. Note that you may put any text, copyright information 
  for example, before the header tag. The encrypted WebDNA must start on the line 
  after the header tag. For example, in order to use WebDNA to automatically convert 
  your template (file.tpl) to an encrypted template (newfile.tpl) you would execute 
  the following: </p>
<pre>[writefile file=newfile.tpl&secure=F]Copyright © 2009 WebDNA Software Corporation
http://www.webdna.us/</pre>
<pre>&lt;!--HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS[!][/!]_ENCRYPTED_2--&gt;
[encrypt]seed=XXXXXXX&amp;product=WCAT[/encrypt]
[encrypt seed=XXXXXXX][include file=file.tpl&amp;raw=T][/encrypt][/writefile]</pre>
<p>After using the above template, your hard disk will contain a file called &quot;newfile.tpl&quot; 
  which you can give to other users, confident that they cannot read or modify 
  it. Using the template is easy -- it works just like any other template.<br>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Note:</b> [!][/!] is a special trick to fool WebDNA into thinking 
    this page is not an encrypted page, and should be treated like a normal template. 
    The [!][/!] is essentially removed during processing, which causes the resulting 
    template to contain the now-correct tag that indicates it is encrypted. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following header tag is valid for recognizing encrypted files:</p>
<p>HAS_WEBDNA_TAGS_ENCRYPTED_2<br>
</p>
<p>In addition to encrypting your seed value, you can specify which product this 
  template works with. Use &#147;WCAT&#148; for WebDNA, &#147;TYPH&#148; for 
  Typhoon, or &#147;WDNA&#148; for any WebDNA product.</p>
<p> Link to an encrypted page and WebDNA automatically decrypts and processes 
  the page. In order to prevent someone from displaying or accessing the decrypted 
  templates, the following precautions have been made:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>command=raw does not work with encrypted templates; nothing is returned</li>
  <li>[include raw=T] cannot be done on encrypted templates; nothing is returned</li>
</ul>
