			<dd>Capitalizes the first letter of all words in a sentence.
		</dl>
		<p>To convert the words of a sentence to capitalized form, put them inside a [Capitalize] context. Only the first letter of each word (any letter following a space) is capitalized. If the remaining letters in the word are uppercase, they will be changed to lowercase. If the word begins with a numeral, the numeral is left unchanged, and the rest of the letters will become lowercase. No attempt is made to be grammatically correct -- articles such as &quot;a, an, of&quot; are capitalized just like any other word.</p>
		<p><b>Example</b> (normally you would put the following text into a .tpl file on your server and use a web browser to link to it):</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>[Capitalize]Some Text that contains upper- and lower case letters[/Capitalize]<br>
			[Capitalize]HI THERE[/Capitalize]<a href="UpperCaseSample.tpl"><br>
			</a>[Capitalize]this is my 1st time at bat[/Capitalize]<br>
			[Capitalize]a of on at the in or[/Capitalize]
		</dl>
		<p>In the examples above, the displayed text will be</p>
		<pre>Some Text That Contains Upper- And Lower Case Letters
Hi There
This Is My 1st Time At Bat
A Of On At The In Or</pre>
		<p>You can use this context to display user-entered text (such as first and last names) so they look more consistent, regardless of how the user typed them.<br>
