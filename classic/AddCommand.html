<DL>
  <DD>Adds a product to the specified shopping cart.
</DL>

<P>To add products to a visitor's shopping cart, click a URL containing
the Add command (alternately, you may embed an <A HREF="AddContext.html">[AddLineItem]</A>
context into a template). Whenever WebDNA receives an Add
command, it opens the shopping cart file (creating a new one if
necessary) and adds the product (identified by its SKU) to the
end of the <A HREF="LineItemsContext.html">LineItems</A> in the
shopping cart. The item's price, taxable, canEmail, and unitShipCost
information is found by looking for the values of those fields
in the product database. You can use a different price by creating
a <A HREF="FormulaFormat.html">Formulas.db</A> database. Also
see <A HREF="RemoveCommand.html">Remove</A>, <A HREF="ClearCommand.html">Clear</A>,
<A HREF="ShowCartCommand.html">ShowCart</A>, and <A HREF="PurchaseCommand.html">Purchase</A>.</P>

<P><B>Example</B> (normally you would link to a URL or form containing
the following information):</P>

<DL>
  <DD>http://yourserver.com/xx.tpl?command=<B>Add</B>&amp;<B>db</B>=SomeDatabase.db&amp;<B>sku</B>=1234&amp;<B>cart</B>=5678&amp;quantity=5
</DL>

<P>The database &quot;SomeDatabase.db&quot; opens, and sku 1234
is found. Shopping Cart file &quot;5678&quot; opens, and a new
line item is added to the bottom of the list. The item's quantity
is 5 (as specified in the command above), and the price is taken
from the database's price field (or, if a formula for [price]
is available in Formulas.db, the price is calculated using that
formula). The page sent back to the browser will be xx.tpl, which
typically contains a <A HREF="LineItemsContext.html">[LineItems]</A>
loop to display the current items in the cart.<BR>
</P>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Note:</B> normally all database filepaths are relative to the local template. 
    If they begin with &quot;/&quot; they are relative to the web server's virtual 
    host root. As of version 3.0, you may optionally put a &quot;^&quot; in front 
    of the filepath to indicate the file can be found in a global root folder 
    called &quot;Globals&quot; inside the WebCatalogEngine folder. This global 
    root folder is the same regardless of the virtual host.<BR>
<BR>
  <B>Note:</B> you may add a maximum of 100 lineitems to a shopping
  cart.<BR>

      <P ALIGN=RIGHT>price</TD> 
    <TD>(Optional) Sometimes you may need to change the price of
      a product while adding it to the cart. Normally you use a <A
      HREF="FormulaFormat.html">formula</A> to vary pricing, but sometimes
      this alternate technique is preferred. Remember to put the lineitem
      change password (see above) into the parameters. There is a security
      risk when using this technique, because outsiders can change
      the price to anything they like.</TD>

  <TR>
    <TD WIDTH="81">
      <P ALIGN=RIGHT>textA</TD> 
    <TD>(Optional) This is extra information of any kind associated
      with this line item. Often used to store extra product information,
      such as &quot;shoe size&quot; or &quot;color.&quot; Also used
      to pass catalog database fields such as [title] through to the
      order file so they may be viewed later without needing the original
      database to look for the value of [title].</TD>

      Overrides &quot;taxable&quot; field in the database - normally
      the information about the item's taxable status is taken from
      a field called &quot;taxable.&quot;</TD>

    <TD>(Optional) &quot;<B>T</B>&quot; or &quot;<B>F</B>&quot;.
      Overrides &quot;canEmail&quot; field in the database - normally
      the information about the item's canEmail (electronically deliverable)
      status is taken from a field called &quot;canEmail.&quot;</TD>

    <TD WIDTH="81">
      <P ALIGN=RIGHT>unitShipCost</TD> 
    <TD>(Optional) A number indicating the item's price for shipping.
      Overrides &quot;unitShipCost&quot; field in the database - normally
      the information about the item's unitShipCost status is taken
      from a field called &quot;unitShipCost&quot;. ShipTotal and GrandTotal

      <DL>
        <DT>You may force the visitor to enter something into a field

        this one.
