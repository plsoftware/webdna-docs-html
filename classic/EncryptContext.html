<font size="5">[Encrypt <i>seed=abcd</i>]Any Text[/Encrypt]</font> 
<dl>
			<dd>Encrypts text using a variety of standard methods.
		</dl>
		<p>To convert text from plain to encrypted, put it inside an [Encrypt] context.</p>
		<p><b>Example</b> (normally you would put the following text into a .tpl file on your server and use a web browser to link to it):</p>
		<dl>
			<dd>[Encrypt seed=abcdefg]Some Text that is private[/Encrypt]&lt;br&gt;<br>
			[Decrypt seed=abcdefg][Encrypt seed=abcdefg]Some Text that is private[/Encrypt][/Decrypt]
		</dl>
		<p>In the example above, the first line of displayed text will be unintelligible, as seen below. The second line decrypts the text and displays it as it was before:</p>
		<pre>;)(*&amp;#$KLJFLKjkhegdlksdfg09814
Some Text that is private</pre>
		<p>Use <a href="DecryptContext.html">[Decrypt]</a> to decode the text. To decrypt a sequence of text, you must set the seed value to exactly the same as when you encrypted it. The seed may be a sequence of up to 8 characters (anything you can type on the keyboard, except '&amp;' or '=' or '[' or ']'). Do not ever let anyone know what the seed value is, because that would allow them to decrypt the text.<br>
		<br>
		This context is most often used to store passwords in a database (such as WebDNA's own Users.db), so that in the unlikely event that someone is able to download the file, the passwords will be unreadable.</p>
		<dl>
			<dd><b>Note:</b> Do not ever forget your passwords or seed values! Even WebDNA Software Corporation cannot decrypt something once it has been encrypted!
		</dl>
		<p>You may optionally choose different special-purpose encryption methods as described in the following table:
		<table border="1" cellpadding="0">
			<tr>
				<th bgcolor="#bbbbbb">&nbsp;Parameter</th>
				<th bgcolor="#bbbbbb">&nbsp;Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					
      <div align="right"> method </div>
				</td>
				
    <td>(Optional) &quot;CyberCash&quot;, &quot;APOP&quot;, or &quot;Base64&quot;. 
      If not specified, then standard WebDNA encryption is assumed. CyberCash 
      is the triple-DES encryption used to communicate with the CyberCash CashRegister 
      servers. Base64 is the encoding (not safe for encryption) standard HTML 
      browsers use for Basic Authentication. APOP is the MD5 encryption used by email servers 
      that support APOP authentication.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<div align="right">
						seed</div>
				</td>
				<td>(Required, except for Base64) Key used to encrypt the text. For CyberCash, this should be the MerchantKey you were assigned when you created a CyberCash merchant account. For standard WebDNA encryption, this is your secret key for decryption later. CyberCash encryption is one-way; it cannot be decrypted by your server.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<div align="right">
						file</div>
				</td>
				<td>(Optional) Specifies a file that is to be encoded using Base64. This is useful for sending e-mail attachments using the WebDNA sendmail context. Note that anything between the opening and closing encrypt tag will be ignored if this parameter is present.<br><b><center>Note:</b> This only applies to WebDNA version 4.0.2rc1 and above.</center></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<div align="right">
						emailformat</div>
				</td>
				<td>(Optional) For Base64 only, this specifies if the resulting encoded string should contain line breaks suitable for e-mail applications. Valid values are either 'T' or 'F' the later being the default. This should be used in conjunction with the file parameter when sending e-mail attachments from a WebDNA template.<br><b><center>Note:</b> This only applies to WebDNA version 4.0.2rc1 and above.</center></td>
