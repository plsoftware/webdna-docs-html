<DL>
  <DD>Writes text to the end of an existing file.
</DL>

<P>To add text to the end of an arbitrary text file, put an [AppendFile]
context into a template. AppendFile creates a new file if one
does not exist already. All text is put at the end of the file,
after any text that may already be there. The file must <B>not</B>
be a database file that WebDNA currently has open. See <A
HREF="WriteFileContext.html">[WriteFile]</A>.</P>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Note</B>: AppendFile does not 'understand' databases.
  If you want to append a new record to the end of a database,
  use <A HREF="AppendContext.html">Append</A> instead.
</DL>

<P><B>Example</B> (normally you would put the following text into
a .tpl file on your server and use a web browser to link to it):</P>

<DL>
  <DD>[AppendFile SomeTextFile]Hello, my name is Grant. The time
  is [time]
  <DD>This is a second line[/AppendFile]
</DL>

<P>The text file &quot;SomeTextFile&quot; opens, and the text</P>

<PRE>Hello, my name is Grant. The time is 13:43:01
This is a second line</PRE>

<P>is written at the end of the file. Notice that carriage returns
inside the context are written to the file exactly as they appear.
Also notice that any WebDNA [xxx] tags inside the context
are substituted for their real values before being written to
the file. You may specify a full or partial path to the file,
as in &quot;/Some Folder/file.txt&quot; (starting from the web
server's root) or &quot;LocalFolder/file.txt&quot; (starting in
the same folder as the template file, looking down into a folder
called &quot;LocalFolder&quot;).</P>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Security Note</B>: By default, all files created by WebDNA
  are tagged with a special code telling WebSTAR not to display
  them via URL. If you want files to be visible to outside browsers,
  use the optional settings below.
