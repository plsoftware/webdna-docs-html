			<dd>Searches using exact matches.

<p>You must tell WebDNA what <b>data</b> to search for, otherwise it will 
  not know what to find. You tell WebDNA what field to look in, and the text 
  to look for (we call it <b>data</b>) by typing the name of the field followed 
  by the word &quot;data&quot; in a URL (or embedded <a href="SearchContext.html">[Search]</a> 
  context).</p>
		<p>If your database has a field called &quot;FirstName,&quot; and you want to look for records that have &quot;Grant&quot; in the FirstName field, then enter a URL something like this:</p>
		<p>http://Results.tpl?command=search&amp;<b>eq</b>FirstName<b>data</b>=Grant&amp;db=SomeDatabase.db</p>
		<p>The template &quot;Results.tpl&quot; displays after the search, and any <a href="FoundItemsContext.html">[FoundItems] </a>contexts in it fill with found records. &quot;eq&quot; stands for &quot;equals&quot;, meaning the FirstName field must <b>eq</b>ual &quot;Grant&quot; exactly, otherwise it will not be considered a match. &quot;eq&quot; is one of many different ways to compare data in your database -- see <a href="SearchComparisons.html">Comparisons</a> for a complete list of all the different ways to compare fields.</p>
		<dl>
			<dd><b>Note:</b> If visitors leave a field blank in a search form, WebDNA assumes they do not &quot;care&quot; to search that field -- it acts as though you had not even specified the field in the search criteria at all. If you want to <a href="SearchBlanks.html">search for blanks</a> (no text in the field whatsoever, not even a space), you can override this behavior by searching for &quot;[blank],&quot; as in eqTitledata=[blank].
