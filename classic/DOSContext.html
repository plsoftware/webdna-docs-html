  contained in the context and displays the results.
</DL>

<P>To embed the results of a DOS Batch file into one of your pages,
put a DOS context into a template. The DOS program contained inside
the context is executed, and any returned value is displayed in
place of the context. Any [xxx] tags inside the context are substituted
first for their real values before the batch file is executed.</P>

<P><B>Example</B> (normally you would put the following text into
a .TPL file on your server and use a web browser to link to it):</P>

<DL>
  <DD>&lt;pre&gt;<BR>
  [DOS]dir c:[/DOS]<BR>
  &lt;/pre&gt;
</DL>

<P>In this example, the DOS command &quot;dir c:&quot; is executed,
and the results (a listing of all the files at the root of C:
drive) is displayed. The &lt;pre&gt; tags are used to format the
results in an HTML page.</P>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Caution!</B> DOS has complete access to your hard disk
  and all programs on your web server. You can write a DOS context
  to erase the contents of your hard disk. However, remote visitors
  to your web site have no way of executing their own DOS contexts
  remotely. They can only execute DOS commands inside a template
  file that <B>you</B> have saved on your web server's hard disk.
