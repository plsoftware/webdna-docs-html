	<DD><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Note:</B></FONT> these instructions are only to be used
	when you have MacAuthorize Hub installed on the same machine as WebDNA itself,
	and you want WebMerchant to control the Hub directly. If instead you have MacAuthorize
	Hub installed on a different Macintosh, then you must set up WebMerchant to control
	MacAuthorize Client locally, which in turn will control MacAuthorize Hub on the remote
	machine.

		<TD>This configuration works fine, too, but is not described in this help document. 
			Simply choose &quot;MacAuthorize&quot; in the pulldown menu in WebMerchant's Preferences,

			MacAuthorize Client according to the instructions provided by Tellan.</TD>

<P>MacAuthorize Hub requires some extra information from WebMerchant, in order for
it to know which bank merchant account to apply credit card charges to. When you
configure your MacAuthorize Hub, you must create a Merchant Account preference for
each of the merchant accounts that the Hub will control. Choose the &quot;Merchant
Accounts...&quot; menu item from the &quot;Setup&quot; menu, as seen below:</P>
<P><IMG SRC="MacAuthHub1.gif" WIDTH="520" HEIGHT="348" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"></P>
<P>If you have not set up MacAuthorize Hub before, then the list of merchant accounts
in the window will be empty. In this case, you will need to use the &quot;New&quot;
button to create your merchant preferences. Type some text that identifies this merchant
account into this sreen.</P>

<P><BR>
Now that you have a merchant account created, you must type its name into WebMerchant's
preferences for &quot;Hub Merchant Identifier&quot;. If you create more stores in
WebMerchant, then you must create a MacAuthorize Hub Merchant Account for each one,
and type the name of the merchant account into WebMerchant's preferences for that
particular store. This assures that each individual store will apply credit to the
correct merchant account.</P>
